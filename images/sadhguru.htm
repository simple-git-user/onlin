		  <h3>About Sadhguru</h3>
          <p>Going beyond mere words of solace,  Sadhguru imparts the yogic sciences, empowering individuals to transform their  lives and take their destiny into their hands.</p>
		  <p>Sadhguru embodies all paths of yoga  � kriya (energy), bhakti (devotion), gnana (knowledge), and karma (action) �  which allows him to mix the “right cocktail” for each individual, who is a  unique combination of these four. So whether it is a villager of rural India or  a corporate chief executive, Sadhguru is available to every human being.</p>
		  <p>Sadhguru has often said that  “society is overripe for a spiritual process”, because despite today’s  technological advances, which have bestowed much of humanity with luxuries and  comforts, most human beings still remain in search of wholeness and purpose in  their lives. Over the last three decades, Sadhguru has worked ceaselessly  towards revitalizing the ancient spiritual sciences that have formed the fabric  of India’s cultural ethos.</p>
          <p>It is Sadhguru’s vision to offer one-drop of  spirituality to every human being, to ensure that each individual can  experience the deepest core of life within. </p><!--
          <h3>Global Outreach</h3>
          <p>With speaking engagements that take him around the world, he is widely sought after by prestigious global forums to address issues as diverse as human rights, business values, and social, environmental and existential issues. He has been a delegate to the United Nations Millennium World Peace Summit, a member of the World Council of Religious and Spiritual Leaders and Alliance for New Humanity, a special invitee to the Australian Leadership Retreat, Tallberg Forum, Indian Economic Summit 2005-2008, as well as a regular at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He was awarded the Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Puraskar (IGPP) for the year 2008 for Isha Foundation&lsquo;s Project GreenHands&lsquo; efforts.</p><br>-->

            <h3>Founder of Isha Foundation</h3>
            <p>Sadhguru is also the founder of Isha Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the wellbeing of the individual and the world for the past three decades. Isha Foundation does not promote any particular ideology, religion, or race, but transmits inner sciences of universal appeal.</p>
			<p>Sadhguru has initiated several projects for social upliftment, education, and environment through which millions of people in rural India have been given the means and methods to overcome poverty, improve their quality of life, and achieve community-based, sustainable development.</p>
			<p>He has founded Isha Outreach, the social development branch of Isha Foundation, with the vision to empower the deprived sections of society towards improved health, education, and environmental wellbeing. The three vehicles of Isha Outreach are Project GreenHands (PGH), Action for Rural Rejuvenation (ARR), and Isha Vidhya, which provide an interconnected and comprehensive approach to transform the lives of the rural poor.</p>
			<p>Sadhguru�s inclusive and holistic approach to current issues and world affairs has impressed some of the most educated and skeptical minds on the planet. Sadhguru is regularly invited to speak at major global conferences such as TED, the Millennium World Peace Summit (UN), and the World Economic Forum (Davos). He has also been a special invitee to the Tallberg Forum, and has given talks on inclusive and responsible leadership at the Australian Leadership Retreat, the World Presidents� Organization and the Young Presidents� Organization.

          <p>“The word ‘yoga’ literally means ‘union’. When you experience everything as one in your consciousness, you are in yoga. To attain to that unity within you there are many ways. For example: hatha yoga. Hatha yoga is a way of working with the body, disciplining the body, purifying the body, preparing the body for higher levels of energy.”</p>

          <p>“Meditation is not something you can do. You can become meditative. You can become meditation. You can never do meditation. It’s a certain quality. This quality has to blossom within you. If you cultivate your body, if you cultivate your mind, your emotions and energy to a certain level of preparedness, meditation will blossom within you.”</p>
